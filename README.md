# CTF Write-Ups
This is a repository that posts to my github.io page and will be the location I store all of the write ups and possibly the notes I take in raw form (depending on how they turn out) I was previously using Medium.com but didn't like how limited I was to placing text and pics in spcific locations, and the medium site is less than ideal to work from. 

## Resources

I have some resources I've gained over the years and have put all of them together in another of my repositories open to the public. I have turned it into part of the awesome collection. Feel free to add to it and I will merge your pull request.

## Other projects

I'm also considering adding notes and what not from other projects I do from hardware to networking so you may see those on here as well.
